Hello, I'm Etienne Spillemaeker, also known as [chpill](https://github.com/chpill) on Github. I'm a software engineer living in France, near Paris.

I have been self-diagnosed with a terminal case of over-engineering.

I write my notes in the [posts](/en/posts) section of this website, you'll probably find a mix of Clojure and Nix in there.

Hello, I'm Etienne Spillemaeker, also known as
[chpill](https://github.com/chpill) on Github. I'm a software engineer living in
France, near Paris.

I have been self-diagnosed with a terminal case of over-engineering. The
suffering (of my colleagues) is intense. More seriously, I like the plumbing
aspect of programming and I often dig into libraries and projects to understand
the inner-working of things.

To nudge myself into cleaning up and clarifying my notes, I decided to publish
them in the [posts](/en/posts) section of this website. You'll mainly find
Clojure in there for now. Do not hesitate to [create an
issue](https://github.com/chpill/chpill.github.io/issues) if you encounter any
errors. You can also contact me directly on my email adress: etienne at
spillemaeker dot com.
